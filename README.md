Kobo Wireless Sync
==================

Hacky Little Python Script I put together while watching a movie one night. When Run, it uploads all epub files in a directory to my Kobo, then refreshes the database. No error handling, no safety, no nothing :)

Put it up here for fun, maybe I'll make it a bit more robust at some point... Auto detecting the ip would be nice...
